<p>OVERVIEW
 One aspect of the project aims at developing a traffic control algorithm for future technology with almost like AI(Artifial Intelegence). The design of the traffic control system can be evaluated in two steps â€“ synthesis and analysis. Several models and multiple control strategies exist, and engineers must decide between them using a priori knowledge of the real system. Previously collected information can help to choose the appropriate model, parameters, measurement and control methodologies to create the optimal solution. </p>

<p>OBJECTIVE OF PROJECT </p>

<p>A newly emerged area is demand estimation through microscopic traffic modelling. The dynamic aspect of traffic simulation requires estimation volumes of traffic continuously. For instance, the observation of constantly varying turning rates. </p>

<p>According to the development of our project it is a step by step analysis of traffic system. At first we consider two routes (i.e. East-West and North-South) have equal volumes of traffic at all time. So both the routes are assigned equal clearance time. </p>

<p>But for some special cases we require human interruption for clearing traffic at some time. Hence a manual mode is essential that is built into the system and can be switched by the traffic police as and when desired. </p>

<p>Emergency sensor is built upon, to continuously check the emergency situations like ambulance, police, and fire-brigade etc providing immediate clearance to it irrespective of present state. After clearance the state is resumed </p>

<p>APLICATIONS &amp; LIMITATIONS </p>

<ul>
<li>The system performs continuous monitoring of traffic flow parameters in the city road network with the help of multiple vehicle detectors of all types (inductive, radar, infrared and video detectors).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p>Adaptive traffic control is performed according to measured or calculated (on the basis of measurements) traffic flow parameters</p></li>
<li><p>Drivers are informed about the recommended speed, according to the current control plans, with the help of electronic speed indicators</p></li>
<li><p>Drivers and pedestrians are informed about the duration of the green and red light signals, existing or potential traffic jams and possible bypasses. </p></li>
</ul>
